## Introduction

JJ is a modern version control system that's gaining popularity. Recently, I decided to give it a more serious try,
after reading propaganda about it on Xitter. Notably from [@mitchellh](https://x.com/mitchellh) and even that weird colorsphere [@hsvsphere](https://x.com/hsvsphere) (turkey mentioned).

Admitedly, I have tried `jj` before but I didn't understand it because I am a certified moron, but for some reason I thought "I need to try this, git is boring me."

I have a decent understanding of `git` and my workflow is pretty optimized with tons of aliases for the commands I use the most. Most notably I have `git purge` which is just an alias to delete all local branches that have been merged and deleted upstream. 
And, I made the alias `git undo` which is just a command to reset the last commit but keep the changes in the working directory. (Made, more like STOLEN from [@joshmanders](https://x.com/joshmanders)).

## Getting Started
So, I'll give you the quick dummy rundown of how to get started with `jj`. I am going to make the assumption that you do know how to use the interwebs to find installation guides so I wont provide them all.

So, I installed `jj` via `cargo`, because I write Rust and I needed to have a relatively simple way to install jj on both my Linux personal machine and my works Macbook Pro.
```bash
cargo binstall --strategies crate-meta-data jj-cli
```

After installation, I went ahead and also installed the `jj-starship` prompt integration, written by [@dillon_mulroy](https://x.com/dillon_mulroy). This is optional, but I like having my prompt show the current branch and status of the repository I am in.

```bash
cargo install jj-starship
```

This is optional I recommend going to the [jj-starship GitHub page](https://github.com/dmmulroy/jj-starship) for everything else. (Thanks Dillon for making this, it's awesome, and a special thanks for your starship.toml so I can intergrate it to my own config).

## Repo setup 

Now that we have `jj` installed, let's do some simple stuff. First, let's not do what everyone else does and create a new repository. Instead, just go to an existing one on your machine. For me it's my [rmv repo](https://github.com/mikkurogue/rmv).

Now, let's assume you have this repo already cloned with `git`. Just go into the directory and run:

```bash
jj git init .
```
This will initialize a `jj` repository in the current directory. You'll also see a message akin to "Track the branch with jj".

So, easy as pie we can run 
```bash
jj bookmark track master@origin
```
This will track the `master` branch from the `origin` remote. Now you can use `jj` commands to interact with this repository.

## Basic Commands

Boring shit done, let's think about making a change. So lets start with making a bookmark to work on with
```bash
# make a new working copy on the current bookmark, in this case master
jj new master
# now make a new bookmark, and change to it thats based off the current commit (the one `master` is set from)
jj new -b my-change
```

Super cool stuff. Time to open your favorite editor (neovim, btw) and then lets do something crazy and change whatever file you want.
Once you are done with editing the file run the command
```bash
jj status # or jj st
```
And you'll see a message that says what files have been changed. I wont go into details with using jj split or anything like that, I'm too stupid to understand it at this point and I wont be able to expain it.

So now, let's make a commit. You have 2 options basically.
```bash
jj describe -m "My cool commit message"
```
This will just describe the commit, but wont make a new "commit" or revision to work off of, you then would do
```bash
jj new my-change
```

However you can also combine these into 
```bash
jj commit -m "My cool commit message"
```
This will both describe the commit and make a new revision to work off of. If you run `jj log` you'll see your commit in the history.
Now, let's say you want to push your changes back to the remote repository. You can do this with:
```bash
jj git push -b my-change
```
This will push your `my-change` bookmark to the remote repository, and thats that. You're done.

Now a quick note, if you want to go back to the `master` bookmark you can just run
```bash
jj new master
```
This will switch you back to the `master` bookmark. And then to sync from the origin you can run
```bash
jj rebase -d master@origin
```

Also, branches and bookmarks are not necessarily the same thing. To a degree they are, but as bookmarks can be moved around more freely they offer more flexibility.
Essentially, a bookmark is just a pointer to a commit at some point in time meaning whenever you run the command
```bash
jj new master # assuming master is a bookmark 
```
You essentially move the bookmark of master to the current working copy/commit you are running the command on.

I might be wrong, but this is at least how I have come to understand it.

## Conclusion

JJ is a powerful and relatively simple tool for version control. It's nice that it's git compatible, so after a few days at work using it I don't feel like I'm mangling the history (actually the history looks so much nicer now for me, other than the merge commits from PR's they suck).

I do think jj has a lot of potential, and I am exicted to see where it will go in the future. I've seen of some speak of a jj forge, which would be a cool way to host jj repositories similar to GitHub. Hopefully, it will be a good experience as github now is well... an anemic dying husk of what microsoft has done to it.
The incessant copilot intergration and kind of bad performence, alongside the "amazing" PR it's gotten lately it's just sad to see.

None the less, jj is cool.

Happy jj-ing, and let's see if I can provide more content about it in the future as I learn more about it myself.
